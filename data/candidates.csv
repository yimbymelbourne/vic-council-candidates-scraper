Alpine Shire Council,Alpine Shire Council,"KNAPPSTEIN, Kitty",Kitty Knappstein," Facilities and structure provide a house; health and community makes that a home. There will be change. Always. How we anticipate and adapt to change has implications for future generations. COVID and natural disasters forced some changes on us, others come insidiously and need more serious consideration. An example. The current push for a cashless economy? Let's think about that. Banks make no money on cash transactions, ATMs are costly to operate and customer service means they have to employ more people. Cashless solves that for them. Natural disasters, cybersecurity issues and outages bring a cashless society to a standstill. And there are those who can't/ won't use technology. Loneliness affects non-digitized community members, especially where life is fast-paced and increasingly technological. In the Netherlands, a large supermarket chain introduced a ""slow lane"" for customers for whom shopping was also a social outing. Other recent influences are continuing to have impacts: AI, climate change, working from home and employment insecurity These have all had impacts on community and individual wellbeing. ""Resilience"" is being promoted everywhere and, the nexus of Alpine Shire Council and Alpine health is key to that: two organisations serving the same community.",kittyknappstein@hotmail.com,0438 592 717,

The community has recognised the great work we have done in the last 4 years. I'm not ready to rest on that yet. I still believe there is more to do for our community. I have lived here all my life, I think that I bring to the table the voice of the average resident. l just like to get things done. I hope we can continue to run the council as a business, keeping rates to a minimum by making smart decisions with the money we have, to serve our community. We can’t keep everyone happy all of the time. We can, focus on what's best for the community as a whole and I believe by doing that, everyone will benefit in the long run.",robarmstrong1234@gmail.com,0418 501 487,

I supported the restructuring of Council, and, in the past seven budgets, there has been no overall rate rise but an improvement in services. I support appropriate development and increased business activity. Without appropriate development, there will be no population to support the services we have which are the envy of our neighbours. I believe targeted development will mean that Ararat will be the community where people will want to work, live and stay, especially our younger generation who need to see a future for them in Ararat.

If elected, my priority will be a more balanced approach to development with an emphasis on a more liveable community that's both climate and energy resilient. I believe Ararat needs more shade trees and parking spaces in busy location like the railway station and schools. Walking and cycling around Ararat and other townships should be easier and safer with more pedestrian islands and cycling lanes on busy roads. I will push for traffic lights on High and Albert Street as well as Lambert and Lowe Street intersections to breakup highway traffic and improve local traffic flows. The Aradale Nurses Hostel is a large, unused accommodation facility and council should facilitate its refurbishment to provide housing for women fleeing domestic violence and the homeless as well as accommodation for seasonal and short-term workers. Despite already hosting a number of wind farms and more renewable energy installations planned, energy costs for Ararat Rural City's residents, businesses and farmers remain too high. There are a number of Victorian councils facilitating community owned renewable energy projects and I believe Ararat Rural City should actively support a community owned energy project to help reduce energy costs locally.",daryl.scherger@bigpond.com,0497 609 944,
Ararat Rural City Council,Ararat Rural City Council,"MEAD, Amanda",Amanda Mead," Ararat residents are increasingly frustrated as council rates rise, yet we see fewer returns on services. Roads are deteriorating, with patchy repairs and overdue maintenance putting safety and accessibility at risk. Meanwhile, the council is overreaching with taxes like the windfall gains tax, unfairly burdening property owners. Instead of focusing on essential services, council currently diverts resources to unnecessary areas and shows no accountability for overspending on projects outside its responsibilities. Our current council needs to change. It's been corrupted by leftist propaganda, and abandoned its core values. I promise to hold the council accountable for budgetary wastage, ensuring every dollar is used to benefit our community. I will put an end to reckless spending and direct resources where they are needed. I am committed to stopping the leftist infiltration of our beautiful Shire of Ararat. Our council should serve the people, not push political ideologies that don’t reflect the values of our community. It’s time for an efficient, transparent, and responsible council that focuses on core services, Roads, Rates and Rubbish, rather than overstepping its role.

Ballarat City Council,Buninyong Ward,"JONES, Mark",Mark Jones," I’m standing for Buninyong Ward to highlight five issues. I want to decrease summer temperatures in Ballarat. Real positive change can be made if we double the size and speed of the city’s current tree planting program; I want to connect Buninyong with Ballarat and all the communities along the way with a walking/cycling trail. The current Canadian Creek trail gets to Mt Clear and just stops dead despite an obvious way forward along the creek; I want to introduce a 24-hour cat curfew much like the current 24-hour dog curfew. Local wildlife will boom. We are behind the times on this issue. Most Victorian councils have a cat curfew. I want to ban wood heating in the built-up area by 2035. The winter air quality in Buninyong is terrible. Wood heaters stink, cost a fortune to run legally, and put kids in hospital with asthma; I want to introduce regular, rational opening hours to the Buninyong Pool. Currently, the hours chop and change many times during the season. Infuriatingly, whether it actually opens or not is then subject to the vagaries of the weather forecast. The pool should be for people not ducks!",kumaonmark@gmail.com,,

Ballarat City Council,Buninyong Ward,"TAYLOR, Ben",Ben Taylor," Council needs to focus on the basics: roads, rates and rubbish! Roads need to be improved to handle increased traffic. Ballarat rates are too high, and rates should be lower and fairer. I have continued to vote against higher rates and in 2020 achieved a freeze on rates, first in 25 years. Council needs a clear plan to manage rubbish, recycling and glass to reduce our carbon footprint. We need experience to manage council spending and deliver the projects as our city grows. We need to have the infrastructure to handle this growth with a clear plan to deliver new schools, libraries, playgrounds and sports grounds. Businesses are doing it tough, and they need to be supported so they can grow to create jobs. I will continue to reduce red tape and help Ballarat businesses through this challenging time. I have worked hard to secure projects for this Ward: Buninyong car park, Warrenheip Streetscape, Dog Parks, upgrades to Royal Park, Buninyong and Mt Clear Recreation Reserves, Mt Clear and Buninyong Kindergartens.

To ensure our community continues to thrive into the future, my priorities are expanding our community facilities, workforce opportunities and basic services, to keep pace with Ballarat’s significant growth. I am committed to developing green spaces and community infrastructure that will meet the future needs of our community, particularly in new growth areas.

Banyule City Council,Bakewell Ward,"ROUMELIOTIS, William",William Roumeliotis," Hi, I’m Will. I’m running for council with Victorian Socialists because I believe in a society that puts people before profit. I have lived in this area my whole life. I’m a student activist and campaign for social and environmental justice as well as workers’ rights. I believe that politicians at all levels of government are in the pockets of the rich, and have grown increasingly out of touch with the people they’re supposed to represent. In a wealthy society like Australia, everyone should have the chance to live a decent life. Today, the people at the top are seeing their wealth grow rapidly, while many at the bottom are being left behind. Councils have a responsibility to address this, and tackle urgent issues like the housing shortage and cost of living crisis. I got involved in politics through the 2019 student strikes for climate change. Recently, I’ve campaigned in solidarity with Palestine. I believe councils should be a place where social justice issues are raised and acted on. If elected in October, I’ll fight for our community and for a fairer Banyule.",,,

I’ve lived in Olympia for most of my life, and I’ve seen how our diverse community is often neglected, lacking the infrastructure and support we need—like a renovated Olympic Leisure Centre or a permanent home for Olympic Neighbourhood House. Essential services are missing, made worse by overdevelopment, inappropriate council rezoning, the selling of public land and assets (like the Rosanna library and the Water Tank site), and the outsourcing of council jobs. Right now, working-class people in Olympia don’t have anyone on the council willing to listen and stick up for them, especially the many young renters in the area like myself. I’ve been involved in community organising for over fifteen years. If elected, I’ll fight to make Banyule Council an accountable, transparent, progressive council that that delivers for the community and puts people before profits.",lucas.moore@victoriansocialists.org.au,0401 733 043,Socialist

Council exists to service the needs of the community in an effective and efficient way, and this fundamental is so often overlooked. The best interests of ratepayers and residents should always be at the forefront in the decision making processes and this includes being mindful of costs at all times. My view as a Certified Practicing Accountant, is that rates and garbage charges should be frozen for twelve months to drive transformation of Council’s finances and provide cost of living relief. Similarly, a complete review of the capital expenditure program and ten year long term financial plan is necessary, with particular emphasis on advocacy programs for health including disability services and positive ageing, education, roads & footpaths and coastal management to protect our environment, properties and infrastructure. Excellent communication and engagement is also essential, and it is imperative for Council to clearly communicate all proposals and decisions in a way that people understand and, by a large majority, support.

Strategic planning interests me and I am proud of my advocacy to adopt the Bass Coast neighborhood character study, housing policy and progression of the San Remo township structure plan.

A graduate of the Australian Institute of Company Directors, I have an intimate understanding of plans, policies and strategies that drive the organization for outcomes on the ground and a desire to work with and strengthen our community.

Bass Coast Shire Council,Western Port Ward,"MINTY, Glenda",Glenda Minty," I am not affiliated with any political party. Government openness and accountability is vital. Planning for superior community livability is my passion. I have been a science teacher -librarian, farmer, rural resident, owner builder, tourism host, licensee, youth mentor, volunteer, CWA office bearer, and Board Director of community organizations, and now North Wonthaggi resident. I have the skills and experience to listen, understand, and effectively represent fairly, the needs and aspirations of my fellow residents and ratepayers. As population pressure increases, I intend to ensure Council plans properly to protect and improve our lifestyle from poor development decisions. I will advocate for height restrictions, sensible zoning, a rural rate review, provision of excellent recreation facilities, better community connections and ensure developers contribute positively to our communities. Council must take an active role in protecting and improving our natural and built environment. We must also plan carefully to keep what we value especially in new estates in Wonthaggi, San Remo and our lovely coastal villages. By being the voice for sensible, commonsense solutions that will benefit us now and the years ahead, my vision for our future has all of us saying, “Why would we ever live anywhere else?”",glendaminty2@gmail.com,0459 105 062,
Bass Coast Shire Council,Western Port Ward,"O'FARRELL, Brian",Brian O'Farrell," I am running as an independent candidate for Western Port Ward. Since retiring to Corinella six years ago, I have observed Council's spending priorities often overlook those of Western Port — our community deserves better. In the latter part of my career, I found myself working in a large regional council where I gained first hand insights into how local government could enrich communities. By listening to community concerns and balancing current and future needs, councils can truly enhance lives. Councils are not a typical business — Bass Coast manages over $1B in assets, and this year will spend $80M delivering services to the community and a further $24M in capital works. This significant budget demands rigorous financial oversight to ensure funds are allocated and used wisely – afterall, it’s our rates at work. As a retired CPA, with expertise in business process improvement, IT, project management, consulting, and senior experience in local government, I am uniquely qualified to provide this oversight. I am committed to transparency, accountability, and fiscal responsibility while prioritising community needs. Together, we can ensure that Western Port receives the attention and resources it deserves.

I live in Bayside and my kids were born and grew up here. Your local council should stick to providing reasonable quality basic services as quickly and cost effectively as possible. Any programs that don’t fit that description should be cancelled asap. Rate increases should be as low as possible and excessive surpluses returned to rate payers via lower rates. Vote for me if you think your council should conservatively seek to maintain the wonderful livability that attracted rate payers to live in this area. Your Council should take active steps to make it easy for local businesses to thrive including allowing for customers to park nearby and dramatically speeding up all services including planning permits. Annual reports should be issued clearly showing rate payers exactly what was collected and spent each year on each program. Council should work for its rate payers and not try to impose progressive ideals over local rate payers. I’m proud of this country and proud of our local area.

Bayside City Council,Castlefield Ward,"CAMPBELL, Richard",Richard Campbell," As an independent candidate for Castlefield, I offer a firm stand against further erosion of local democracy as instanced by the people squeezing of the proposed Rescode changes. We should question whether the assumption of a 70% increase of housing in Brighton by 2050 is realistic when China, Australia's prime economic driver, is rapidly contracting following its national property collapse and when key drivers of the Victorian economy are weak. After 6 decades of oil and gas production, Bass Strait is depleted. The record of densification is also poor with many recent buildings uninsurable or requiring onerous outlays. Instead, there are viable options to use existing housing stock combined with good design. Poor housing is economically wasteful. A further issue is the restraint on Council budgeting as inflation continues and more extreme weather events add pressure. The capacity to increase rates will be limited by moderate growth at best. As a former municipal Councillor (Mornington) I bring budgetary experience to a platform of effective community consultation, heritage sensitivity and initiatives like localised energy generation and storage.

Core issues go unaddressed, like maintenance of roads, footpaths, street and beach lighting and cleaning, enhancing shopping strip attractiveness, inadequate parking, increasing neighbourhood crime and home invasions. Instead, our councillors busy themselves with non-council matters like prohibition of nuclear weapons and future of Australia Day - neglecting fundamentals. Let’s get back to basics. This Council term has delivered few new major projects, but rates keep increasing by the maximum allowable. As Council is custodian of $4000 million assets we need and deserve better. The previous Council got major projects, approved. budgeted and started. Financial responsibility was its hallmark. Debt reduced from $16 million to zero. and spending concentrated to where most needed. This current council wastes money on breaking contracts, building rarely used pocket parks, and overall financial incompetence. You ask why? so do I.

If you have similarly observed them, you will understand my desire to make a change. As a teacher, educating students is paramount. But socialising them into respectful citizens is a necessity, with increasing youth crime. Council needs to be more interactive with police and the state government to address this unacceptable antisocial behaviour. Our youth need more community facilities, as well as a wide range of sporting facilities. Yet council cancelled abudgeted and already contracted football oval at Elsternwick Park. A cancelled contract meant ratepayermoney was wasted, and young people were deprived of an acceptable playing oval. This must stop. Having lived and been educated in Bayside, I now want to be part of Council to ensure our rates are thoughtfully spent.

For twenty-five years, my family and I have called Kew home. I’ve led school parents' associations, managed junior football teams, supported refugees and volunteered for climate groups. Over the past three months, I’ve knocked on over 3,000 doors - and you’ve told me you want genuine community engagement and a real say in important council decisions. You want action and communication on the shambolic Kew Recreation Centre, protection of our leafy streets, safety for pedestrians along Earl/Asquith Streets and sensible climate policy. I’m running because we deserve a higher standard of leadership—leadership that listens to our community, represents our values, and acts in our best interests. I will work hard to engage with you and bring my expertise and experience to deliver practical solutions that benefit our community. As your local councillor, I will promote a culture of transparency and accountability within Boroondara Council.

Boroondara City Council,Studley Ward,"SULLIVAN, Kym",Kym Sullivan," As a 30 year resident who cares deeply about Kew, I will advocate to : 1) Stop the demolition of the Kew Library. 2) Convert the Vic Roads site to an oval & playground to help address the shortage of parks and public sports grounds in the Kew Junction area. 3) Pause future large developments in our leafy streets to avoid a repeat of the demolition of 3 houses for 27 units in Walpole Street. 4) Give our canopy trees greater protection by significantly increasing the penalties for wrongful removal. 5) Upgrade the Kew Depot to receive all recyclables and open a container deposit depot. 6) Brighten the shopping centre with flower boxes plus extra tidying & watering of garden beds. 7) Create more Street Art in Kew Junction. 8) Build more affordable housing for Kew's homeless. 9) Help the Kew community reconnect by reinvigorating the Kew Community Festival and installing a resident theatre group in the Kew Court House. In respect of the Kew Library, this is one of Victoria's most spacious libraries and must be preserved for future generations. It is a heritage-grade building that can easily be modified to service the needs of today's humble library-goer.",,,
Borough of Queenscliffe Council,Queenscliffe Borough Council,"RULE, Di",Di Rule," I promise to go back to basics, to focus on what matters. Our biggest challenge is to remain relevant and independent – not overtaken by neighbouring councils. That requires an efficient administration which delivers quality projects and provides services that improve our lives. To do this we need tight governance that gets the basics right. Clear budgeting. Streamlined systems. Environment and heritage protection. Completing projects on time and on budget. Funding more capital works by trimming costs and thinking outside the square to raise revenue. Our history and natural features rival any destination and have the potential to attract visitors from all over. My aim is that the Borough not just survives but thrives through sustainable development and balanced economic growth for the benefit of residents and the pleasure of visitors. Community engagement – and then representing ratepayers’ interests with honesty and transparency – is essential. I’m committed to listening, to being accessible, to making informed decisions and building a strong community and a bright future for all.

Borough of Queenscliffe Council,Queenscliffe Borough Council,"GRIGAU, Donnie",Donnie Grigau," This past term on the council has been eye-opening, revealing inefficiencies and poor decision-making that prioritises global over local issues, offering little value to Queenscliffe ratepayers. The Borough must focus on core responsibilities: asset renewal, maintenance, and efficient local services. With over $5.6 million allocated to staff wages and contractor fees from a small rate base of $7.5 million, little remains for asset upkeep. Queenscliffe is reliant on income from caravan park revenue, investments & operational grants. Without this income, council will be posting losses. I believe local government should be responsible and accountable for ratepayer funds, delivering local services and enhancing community amenities. We must prioritise asset maintenance to a community-acceptable standard, protect the environment, and ensure our community is liveable and attractive to visitors. The council must enforce local laws and policies fairly to represent everyone, avoiding division and favouritism. My vision includes elevating council service levels and fostering pride in Point Lonsdale and Queenscliff. We must recognise our identity as a coastal, regional, rural township—not a suburb of Melbourne or Geelong. Vote for me, Donnie Grigau, as your first choice, and preference candidates with similar platforms. Back to basics.",donniegrigau@gmail.com,0480 267 951,

I am running for election to Brimbank Council, representing Horseshoe Bend Ward, to ensure that our ward receives a fair share of services and infrastructure. No more Sunshine centric thinking. Since the amalgamation of Keilor and Sunshine Councils, three decades ago, Horseshoe Bend Ward has been overlooked repeatedly in favour of Sunshine. First the enormous council offices were built in Sunshine and almost everything since has been for Sunshine: Sunshine Masterplan, Sunshine Station Superhub, Sunshine Priority Precinct Vision 2050, and more recently, the mammoth Sunshine Energy Park development on the former Sunshine Tip, estimated to cost $500 million. My vision is Local Council - Local Focus. This includes splitting Brimbank into two councils: one in the north centred on Keilor and one in the south centred on Sunshine. Since Brimbank is one of the largest councils based on land size, population, revenue and bureaucracy, and the infrastructure already exists, this is achievable without any increase in rates.

Living locally in Mount Derrimut Ward, I want to rebuild our Council so that ratepayers can be properly served. If elected my priorities for Mount Derrimut Ward are giving Derrimut and Deer Park a strong voice in Council. I will strongly advocate for Council Rate Cuts, cutting rates by 10% in real terms over the next 3 years, because everyone requires a fair go and relieve cost of living pressures. I will be opposing inappropriate high density toxic chemical factories located so close to residential homes. Our safety comes first, not profits! Safety is another important factor, I will advocate for the Police Station to open 24/7 and not closing at 5pm everyday, as it is currently. Crime went up 3% and we desperately require more safety/CCTV for our residents. I'm also advocating for a new Library in Derrimut to cater for our growing families and more adequate Public Transport, in addition to duplicating Robinsons Road.

Since 1991 I have resided in the Grevillea Ward with my wife and children. Like you, I’ve watched the demise of the previous council, IBAC’s investigation and its removal. I feel that council needs a new start, with new people with integrity and fresh ideas. Everyone is currently feeling the financial cost of living crunch and the payment structure for rates needs to change. Currently, we have only two options for payment, one or four instalments. I’ll be pushing for additional options of six or nine instalments. I’ll investigate ways to generate commercial revenue streams to reduce your rate burden. I want to serve on a council that works for the people and that concentrates on local needs. I am interested in good roads, parks, reserves, modern infrastructure and preserving services. I don’t want to see the council’s time expended on issues beyond its remit, where our comments are not relevant. This wastes council time and ratepayers’ money.

I have lived in Casey for over 24 years and never have I been more disgusted with any council than I am with our previous one. The role of councillor is supposed to ensure the good governance of our assets. Instead, we saw our Councillors place their political allegiance ahead of us, and at our expense. Matters that should have been discussed in open meetings were made behind closed doors without any accountability. Money that could have been spent on support programs, playgrounds, community gardens (allotments) and fixing potholes, was spent on political promotions. Tales of political donations for favours and suitcases of money were exposed on TV, to our shame, and where is our last Mayor? I hold no political affiliation nor do I hold any desires to become a state or federal politician. I am an accountant with corporate governance and risk management training and experience.

I’m retired now, after working for big companies and running my own business. I've seen our previous corrupt council rightly dismissed, and I’d like to see our new council working with integrity and transparency, for the benefit of the residents. Residents know best, and counsellors need to respond. I am concerned with the amount of time taken for the completion of road works in our city. Cost blow outs for projects should not be the norm; should be unacceptable. An important road project I would commit to is the widening of Pound Rd in the small section east of Hallam Rd. Rates are a major cost for residents and business owners alike. I will stop the ever increasing rates and get Casey council back to basics. I'd like to see an end to the unnecessary spending on some of the woke agenda programs which are not part of council’s jurisdiction.

Central Goldfields Shire Council,Maryborough North Ward,"SPROULL, Wayne",Wayne Sproull," I was honoured to be elected at the 2020 council elections. As a Maryborough ward councillor I have been successful in helping to establish our inaugural Pride Festival, now Outburst. I partnered with community and council to establish the Central Goldfields climate action plan, and I currently sit on the board of the CVGA which assists local government with climate change mitigation and adaptation. I am a member of the Maryborough RSL branch ANZAC day committee and assisted Guardians of the Spirit launch their campaign to honor the ANZAC spirit. I also MC'd the volunteer forum on behalf of the Volunteer Resource Centre. During my term I have advocated for stronger inclusion of local content in council procurement, I voted against the withdrawal from aged care services and also moved a successful motion to prevent another take away liquor license in Maryborough. Much has been achieved but there is always more to do. The Princes Park grandstand work, securing a home ground and clubrooms for our soccer club, fishing platforms at the Goldfields reservoir, Maryborough community garden rehoming and advancing our work toward a higher education hub which will provide opportunity for our community to access supported higher education locally.",waynesproull@gmail.com,0425 872 259,
Central Goldfields Shire Council,Maryborough North Ward,"BARTLETT, Geoff",Geoff Bartlett," Dear Voter, I have three questions for you. Why is the Shire satisfaction survey result sitting at a record low of only 47%? Why are rates continually going up during a cost of living crisis? What caused the Outdoor Pool, Town Hall and Bristol Hill Tower to fall into states of disrepair and periods of closure? Fellow Citizens, my dissatisfaction with this mismanagement is what prompted me to step up, offer you an alternative and be part of the solution. Already this year as a Citizen I successfully petitioned council to install disabled parking near the Doctors clinics. I aim to continue in this vein by working for the betterment of our Shire whether I’m elected or not. Thus my focus is fully upon (1) Rebuilding Trust with you the Citizen, highlighting your concerns at the Council Table. (2) To understand and import the lessons of how a neighbouring Shire has achieved a 0% Rate Increase for six consecutive years. (3) Re-open the Intermediate and Toddlers Pools this summer!

I’m a Preston local and have lived in the area for many years. I’ve been a teacher and unionist for most of my working life and fought for secure jobs and improved conditions for educators. The cost-of-living crisis is drastically impacting people in our community. I want a council that addresses high rents and other issues that make life harder for Darebin residents, that ensures developers provide affordable and liveable housing, and that provides quality and accessible public services for all. Massive redevelopment is planned for High St, and this should be for the benefit of the community, not just profits for investors. I’m for the public acquisition of Preston Market. It's the heart of Preston, and what happens to it shouldn’t be decided by billionaire property developers! I've been a community organiser and activist for two decades. In recent times, I’ve campaigned in solidarity with the people of Palestine, and in the campaign to save Preston Market.

Rates: I will push for a careful review of rate increases to ensure we are not overburdening residents. Your hard-earned money should be used wisely, with transparency and accountability. 2. Roads: Our roads are the veins of our city. I will prioritise the planning of traffic management to allow for reduced traffic congestion. 3. Rubbish: Effective waste management is a fundamental council responsibility. The council’s primary job is to serve its residents, not to engage in wasteful projects. By refocusing on rates, roads, and rubbish, we can deliver better results for our community and hopefully reduce cost of living expenses. Let’s return to basics and build a stronger, more effective City of Darebin. Thank you for your support!",markjohnston2024@icloud.com,0457 170 067,

Darebin City Council,South East Ward,"LUNT, Carolyn M.",Carolyn M. Lunt," After eight years of one party controlling Council, it’s time for change. While the South-East ward voters chose wisely in electing Cr. Emily Dimitriadis last time, the threat of continued domination of Council by one party is a frightening prospect. I’m proud to be part of the Darebin Progressive Independents Network. We hope to be a constructive influence on Council and bring an end to party political induced in-fighting. I’m especially concerned about how Darebin’s Climate Emergency has stalled. The modest actions in the recently adopted Climate Emergency Plan (CEP) are not commensurate with an emergency. They distance Council from acting through externalising the problem and making it someone else’s responsibility. An emergency requires Council to position itself centrally and to lead. I will advocate tirelessly for a strong strategic plan that integrates climate adaptation, city presentation, biodiversity, open space, streetscape treatments, increased re-use and treatment of stormwater, re-designed roads and pavement treatments to help prepare the city for a hotter future. We must achieve a powerful focus around all these issues. Only Progressive Independents will push climate adaptation to the forefront of Council’s activities. Vote for change. Vote Progressive Independent. Vote 1: Carolyn M. Lunt; Vote 2: Emily Dimitriadis.",intuit@bigpond.net.au,0400 504 697,

Like many, I have had to travel – and pay - to access health services that meet my children’s needs. These services shouldn't be a privilege for those who can find and afford them. State government funding cuts threatening jobs and services in regional health need to be taken as seriously as the timber industry transition. Our Council has an important advocacy role to play. Neighbourhood Houses provide important supports – in our more remote communities they’re often the only services. Many provide food banks and community meals. But our Council doesn't support Neighbourhood Houses the way nearly every other Council in the state does. Climate change is making fires and floods more frequent and more severe.

They have no vision for a better Frankston. Please choose a new candidate this election who will put Frankston first. Better the devil you don't know.

The claim that high-rise living lowers housing costs is flawed; it actually increases land-prices and decreases living space per person, and carries many other hidden costs. The profit motive is undermining our rights to participate in decision-making regarding our city and the protection of green spaces. I will advocate for these rights and seek alternative ways to combat the threats to our neighbourhoods, waterfront, and local environment.

Glen Eira City Council,Mallanbool Ward,"MAGEE, Jim",Jim Magee," Experienced independent Glen Eira Councillor, I remain committed to serving our community. As a long term resident of East Bentleigh, I have proudly watched our area grow and flourish into a highly sought after place to live. However, this growth has come with increased pressure and responsibility on delivering quality services to kindergartens, child and maternal health centres, schools, sports clubs and other community groups. For me, it is essential that council meets this growing demand. The Mallanbool community deserves nothing less than safe parks and playgrounds, well-lit streets and footpaths maintained in excellent condition. Upgrading our stormwater drains and addressing the traffic and parking issues in local streets are also critical to maintaining our suburban amenity. I am passionate about protecting our environment and will continue to advocate for a substantial increase in our urban tree canopy and to greatly restrict the moonscaping of house blocks by developers. It is essential that Glen Eira Council and State Government recognise the rapid expansion in Mallanbool Ward, and we all work together to ensure that it remains a wonderful place to live.

I am a passionate Glenelg Shire resident with a young family who has lived in Portland for 39 years. Our region has an unprecedented opportunity in the years ahead to thrive on all fronts.

I will support increased investment in high-use infrastructure that meets the needs of our community for the next 50 years.

I’m now an international consultant on disaster and climate change resilience based at my home near Cape Bridgewater. I support open local government, approachable Council meetings and genuine community participation in long term planning. We have to listen to our different communities and business sectors to build a clear, agreed, picture of how and where we want to develop, and what we value most. We should be expanding into areas like renewable energy and eco-tourism, but for that we need to attract and keep the “missing” 25-45 age-group through more support for youth, good jobs and childcare. Council needs to be a strong advocate for better health, education and transport services from State/Federal Governments.

The potential to diversify our economy exists through local produce and cultural trails connecting our smaller townships.

Sound infrastructure, including well-maintained roads, is essential for farmers and industry, as well as safe accessibility for all users. Council can contribute to safeguarding our environment by encouraging sensitive development, eco-tourism, waste reduction and renewable energy use. Sport, recreation and the arts are crucial to our physical, mental and social wellbeing, and in building community connections.

Greater Bendigo City Council,Lockwood Ward,"McILRATH, John",John Mcilrath," John McIlrath’s life has been defined by service – to his family, his country, his community, and now he’s ready to serve the Lockwood ward as a councillor. At 17, McIlrath enlisted in the Australian Regular Army, where he trained as a heavy diesel mechanic and deployed to East Timor in 2000. His commitment to protecting others didn’t stop there. After his military service, he joined Victoria Police, dedicating seven years to law enforcement, including four years on the beat in Bendigo. Today, McIlrath – who has two adult children who live in Bendigo – runs a successful small business, creating jobs and driving economic growth. He’s keen to step up to serve on council with a clear mission: to represent the majority of residents and ensure their voices are heard. His priorities include boosting community safety, enhancing local amenities, cutting bureaucratic red tape for businesses, preserving the region’s rich history and ensuring ratepayers’ money is invested in projects that truly benefit the entire community. With a lifetime of service, McIlrath is the right choice to lead the Lockwood ward.

After wanting to put my hand up for years things have fallen into place, and 2024 is finally the right time. I came to Bendigo nearly twenty five years ago at 17 for university, and built my life here.

I am running for Whipstick ward because, as a socialist and trade unionist, I believe that everybody in our community deserves to live with dignity. In the last year the cost of living has exploded for working people. From housing affordability to medical costs or the cost of child care, local councils have a role to soften the blow. Unfortunately the current council has decided to cut council services such as home-care for our elderly, forcing people prematurely out of their homes. Bendigo residents deserve representatives who understand how difficult it is to find a child care place, who will fight to expand the council funded childcare. You deserve a representative who knows first hand how desperate the housing situation is for both renters and first home-buyers. and will struggle relentlessly to boost housing supply.

Victorian Socialists stands for something that has been lost in all political parties - standing with people before profit! For working-class residents, the cost of living has increased drastically for basic necessities like food, petrol and bills.

In Victorian Socialists, we believe that we can work in councils to advocate for the voices of migrants, workers, renters and young people. I'm a second generation Chinese-Cambodian. Born right here in Dandenong hospital, I've lived in the Greater Dandenong region nearly all my life, seeing the changes needed here through the decades. Besides working in retail trade, I'm a trade union member. I've been involved in anti-Nazi rallies, fighting for migrant and refugee rights, election campaigns for Victorian Socialists as well as supporting strikes by staff workers in universities.

Since the Council was dismissed in 2016 there has been a Commission of Inquiry, the Council has been under administration for 18 months and two sets of Municipal Monitors have been appointed.

With my commitment to inclusive leadership and my active involvement in local volunteer work and support for nonprofits and small businesses, I am well-positioned to advocate for underrepresented groups, promote cost-effective waste management, and enhance historical preservation.

With 12 years of service as a current Councillor, a former Mayor and deputy Mayor, I ask for the privilege to represent you the residents of the Lower Goulburn ward of Greater Shepparton. As the largest town outside Shepparton, Mooroopna is and has always been an integral and historically significant town of the Goulburn Valley. Smaller communities such as Undera, Undera nth, Coomboona and St Germains complete the picture of a true Town and Country ward. Lower Goulburn deserves strong advocacy for secure irrigation water, better flood recovery and mitigation assistance and a much needed second river crossing to name but a few necessities and aspirations. As the gateway to the west for over a hundred and fifty years Mooroopna’s expanding retail and manufacturing base along with its passionate sporting and community organisations need nurturing to continue its success. Together with my experience and commitment to results driven advocacy, we can take the next step in securing our economic growth, affordable housing for the vulnerable and harnessing the competitive advantages throughout the Lower Goulburn ward.",dinnyadem@mail.com,0499 228 118,

A vote for me is a vote to get back to basics and to get back to the core function of local government; roads rates and rubbish. Sure, there's big projects that need to be addressed, but without a conservative approach to the budget, these projects will remain out of reach and the basics will never be fixed. For too long certain members of council have used their position to push an agenda that does not serve the majority, only the minority and as a result, ratepayers are not getting the value for money they deserve. My agenda is simple 1. work to get council budget back to surplus 2. focus on rural communities and smaller towns in the shire to get their fair share 3. advocate for a return to weekly red bin collection 4. make our roads ""carworthy"" 5. investigate the efficiency of COGS and its departments and 6. above all else, listen listen listen to the community.",claaslodge@gmail.com,0409 991 509,

I opened Gamer's Resort five years ago, a Greater Shepparton business that provides a great opportunity for me to connect with the local community, and understand pressures on small businesses. My time on council has seen many positive changes, including a reduction to the deficit, a new CEO, endorsing local tender contracts, and officially opening the Vibert Reserve Pavilion. There’s lots of exciting projects evolving in the McEwen Ward, including the design consultation for a $33M sports stadium redevelopment, a new $1.7M BMX pavilion to attract world class events, and a new $24M campus for Verney Road School.

With your vote I’ll be ‘your voice for common sense’ at the Council table, ensuring transparency, and greater value for your rate money. The McEwan Ward has been home to my family for 100 years!

We’re so lucky that our river and wetlands allow us to get in and around the natural environment which delivers health and wellbeing outcomes for us all. My research confirms that the sports precinct has the potential of delivering a $70 million-dollar economic impact across the Greater Shepparton region, and this will benefit everyone!

Horsham Rural City Council,Pine Lake Ward,"ROSS, Ian",Ian Ross," HRCC must improve its decision-making by prioritising with sound governance, including cost-benefit analysis, risk management, and meaningful community engagement. Major projects are being undertaken without these crucial elements, and the community must be consulted before significant decisions are made, eg parking meters and wombat crossings, mining at the WIFT. Our rural roads are in a poor state, with gravel roads not maintained to a safe, drivable standard. A significant increase in funding is needed to address this. Additionally, our outer communities require better planning and strategies to improve the entire municipality. I have deep roots in this area. I farm with my wife and raised our family in an isolated corner of HRCC. I was locally educated, studied at Longerenong, and then returned to the family farm with many challenging circumstances. My community involvement includes playing for local football and cricket teams, 19 years in Apex, local churches, 12 years as Director on the GHCMA, and past Chair of my local VFF.

As a lifelong Sunbury local and SES Rescue Volunteer, I’ve worked hard to deliver on my promises including upgrading our BMX track and our athletics track, delivering the multi-deck carpark, and investing in the Jacksons Hill Arts Hub. Many of us are struggling with the rising cost of living. That’s why I’ll continue to fight to keep rates low, while protecting essential services for families. I’m focused on making sure your money is invested in projects that directly benefit our community, like a year round 50 meter indoor pool at a redeveloped Sunbury Aquatic Centre. I’m committed to delivering more for Sunbury. I’ll fight for our second sports stadium, a fenced playgrounds program, and upgrades to roads and community facilities. I’ll also advocate for local government contracts to prioritise local small businesses, creating local jobs. Our community needs leaders who will fight for us.

With recent electoral changes, this ward will finally be represented by a local, not Councillors from Sunbury. I’ve spent the past eight years delivering results for Meadow Valley Ward as Councillor and Mayor, and I’m ready to do the same for Tullamarine Ward. As a long-time Gladstone Park resident with family in Tullamarine, I know our community’s needs. Over the past four years, I’ve delivered key upgrades for Gladstone Park’s Tennis, Soccer, and Cricket Clubs, as well as the Westmeadows and Tullamarine Tennis and Footy Clubs. Looking ahead, I’ve secured $17 million for projects across our ward, including upgrades to Westmeadows Village, the War Memorial, Willowbrook Reserve, John Coutts Reserve, and more. These victories weren’t easy, and with just one Councillor representing us, it’s vital to have someone who shows up, builds relationships, and gets results. I’ve raised more issues than any other Councillor and fought to ensure every dollar is spent wisely. I’m accessible, responsive and contactable. I have the track record, and I’m ready to keep delivering for our community. Contact me at 0412248328 or kurt4hume@gmail.com. Let’s keep moving forward!",kurt4hume@gmail.com,0412 248 328,

Kingston City Council,Caruana Ward,"WHITE, Caroline",Caroline White," Now more than ever we need local government representation that has no affiliation to any political party, a truly independent voice to represent the best interests of our community and our home. As a small business owner of over a decade, I bring strong business acumen and leadership. I grew up in Aspendale and have lived in Kingston most of my life, so I am very passionate about where we live but I am also concerned about the area’s long-term liveability. My aims are to reduce council rates to help residents with cost-of-living pressure by cutting wasteful spending, optimising council resources and operational efficiency, increasing transparency, integrity and accountability and improving the culture of council to facilitate entrepreneurship, economic and business growth. I believe Council needs to bring the focus back to roads, rates and rubbish. I will continue to fight against the inappropriate over development of Kingswood Golf Course and the dumping of toxic Big Build waste by the State Government. I will fight for the preservation of our Green Wedge, the urgent upgrade needed to Tootal Rd and all other deteriorating roads and footpaths, and basketball courts and ovals to properly accommodate our sporting communities.",caroline@votecaroline.com,0411 256 653,

I was an electrician for 20 years, I moved into hospitality and entertainment not long ago. I now work in sales. I’ve never been political. But way Kingston City Council has increased rates without passing on any more value to the ratepayer is unacceptable. I am putting my money where my mouth is and doing something about it. If the council is so single-minded in raising rates, it should give something back to the community – not just certain people, but the entire community. Be it a new park space, lower fees at council facilities, or quality of life improvements for all. The council’s priorities are all over the shop. I think the council needs to stop funding ridiculous bin stickers and other things that people don’t use or want and direct those funds to fixing potholes, making small business easier to run, and expanding services for our most vulnerable in the community, such as the elderly.

As a local resident, mother, a Chartered Accountant, I know firsthand the financial pressures families, businesses and local charities face and understand the challenges of putting food on the table and paying household bills. Kingston must deliver lower rates to assist all ratepayers impacted by cost-of-living crisis; our retirees deserve better and our children need a safe environment and access to facilities to support their education and development. We must invest in neighborhood watch and get youth off the streets to help reduce ever increasing crime rates and create better, safer neighborhoods for all.

What has become obvious is the neglected plight of young teenagers. Too old for after school programs, the 12 to 16 year olds are not catered for by Council during holiday periods. They can't afford expensive fees to join clubs. Participation in activities i.e. soccer, gymnastics is prohibitive. They tell me ""Miss, we can't go"". They end up loitering, looking at phones or stuck at home unsupervised. Parents need to work. Council needs to address how to implement affordable leisure, entertainment and sporting programs over school holidays, to prevent youth crime which stems from this neglect.

But the burden of paying for these services can't lay solely on people who work for a paycheck. The ultra-wealthy, now more than ever, must pay their fair share.

Kingston City Council,Chicquita Ward,"BALDOCK, Ian",Ian Baldock," Lets make Kingston equal for all, stopping money being wasted on political policies, but concentrating on basic council responsibilities (roads, rubbish, cleaning, parks, assistance to those in need). No racial policies, treat all equally, no matter where born or how long we have been in Kingston. No sexist policies, treating all the same no matter their varied sexual choices. No wastage of ratepayers funds, such as the $90+ million being spent on the new aquatic centre to replace the poorly maintained Don Tatnell pool, which would only have cost $9 million to repair – costing ratepayers more than $80 million of unnecessary expense into the future. Council has not been supporting their citizens well, and needs fresh, non-political blood. For too long it has just been seen as a rubber-stamp to Spring St’s policies & directives. I believe that councillors should have no political affiliations, & just concentrate their efforts towards improving life for their ratepayers.

As a trusted community leader and not a member of a political party, I will fight for what's right. I listen to community and will represent our best interests. My family lives in Longbeach so I understand the issues affecting us. As a ratepayer I want to see attention given to roads, rates, rubbish, and more to ensure Longbeach is the best Ward in Kingston. Longbeach needs Council investment now, we need a plan and action to upgrade our shopping precincts, fix the station crossing, keep the bins from overflowing, upgrade our parks and sport facilities, take action on climate change and ensure our pets are safe and returned quickly when lost. I will work to prevent rate rises and improve housing.

As a ratepayer, I'm frustrated by the council's wasteful spending on external consultants and identity politics projects, while our basic infrastructure is being neglected. Given my experience as a project manager in civil engineering and construction of water infrastructure , I commit to scrutinising council capital expenditure to ensure ratepayers' money is spent wisely and projects deliver tangible value. I will also ensure routine asset maintenance isn't postponed due to budget reallocations towards vanity projects. Maintaining the character of our neighbourhood and its liveability is a priority, which means standing up to protect our open green spaces, streets from being overshadowed by multistorey developments and our roads being choked by bad road traffic management decisions.

In these tough times it is my promise to keep rates to the rate cap or lower, to fix the holes in our roads and to fix the garbage collection. The current council raised rates during COVID, held a fire sale of council owned land, sold our kindergartens, the pride of Victoria, and changed the garbage collection from weekly to fortnightly. We need that fixed. We also need support for our seniors by keeping the pensioner rebate, support for sport for boys, girls, men and women and support for people doing it tough.

Council increased rates during COVID and every year since, exited kindergarten service provision, reduced rubbish collections, and approved reckless developments while selling community assets, at the same time our roads and footpaths have deteriorated. The State Government's 2051 housing targets of 47,000 new homes within Knox threaten to overcrowd our neighbourhoods, overwhelm services, and place severe strain on infrastructure. To address these challenges, we need new leadership who will challenge unrealistic plans and ensure Council’s $203 million budget is managed effectively. If elected, I’ll work to keep rates capped, implement an effective road and footpath maintenance program, and promote responsible development. I’ll focus on enhancing sports and recreation facilities and public infrastructure, while maintaining our natural bushland and neighbourhood character.

Knox residents need to feel safe in their homes and walking around the community, along the bike trails, commuting on public transport and shopping precincts.

I’m an independent candidate because local government should be about community, not politics. My focus is on practical, smart spending - making sure your dollars are used wisely to maintain and improve our roads, parks and recreation facilities; and promoting jobs and tourism in our region. I want to ensure Council gets back to basics, spending efficiently and delivering value for all of us. I believe in transparent, responsible governance that listens to residents’ needs. It’s time to bring back common sense in local Council. If you agree, I ask for your vote.",danielyoung3435@gmail.com,0437 401 095,

Our community is decaying, and property developers are getting their way every time.

In a wealthy society like Australia, everyone should have the chance to live a decent life. But today, only the people at the top are growing their wealth. Councils have a responsibility to help turn this situation around and tackle urgent issues like the housing shortage and cost-of-living crisis. I’ve been a socialist for many years. I have stood with Indigenous people in the fight against racism. I have been involved in the fight against the big corporations that are burning up our planet. And now you can find me in the protests in solidarity with the people of Palestine.

That’s why my vision for Maribyrnong focuses on listening and working with our community, defending and rebuilding high value services like early childhood education and care, and better planning for quality affordable and social housing. My priorities also include more green space, a maintenance blitz to fix rundown infrastructure, building up central Footscray by cracking down on developers hoarding disused land, and taking practical steps to keep our community safe, vibrant and cohesive. I’m running to fight for fairness on Council as your local voice for our community and a Labor Party member. With your support, I’ll bring my experience in advocacy to change Council for the better.

Maribyrnong City Council,Braybrook Ward,"ROBERTSON, Catherine",Catherine Robertson," Hi, I’m Catherine. I’m running for Maribyrnong Council as a candidate with the Victorian Socialists because for years I’ve watched politicians ignore our suburbs to instead help out their big business mates. Whether it’s housing, public transport and roads, or access to quality public services and green space—Melbourne's west has been denied the investment we deserve. Our area used to be an affordable community for migrants and workers. But it’s becoming impossible to live in. We’ve seen developers make millions from the soaring cost of home ownership and rent, whilst the state government sells off desperately needed public housing. Councils have a responsibility to help turn this situation around, but they need people who will fight for change. Working people and our interests need to be prioritised over the wealth of a small few. As a long-time activist I have been part of organising local campaigns for social justice, climate action, Palestine, and against racism, inequality and the privatisation of services. I am a trade unionist, having worked in both universities and hospitals, and am now completing my Masters degree to become a secondary teacher.

Maribyrnong City Council,Sheoak Ward,"CASANOVA, Ari",Ari Casanova," Many of us know Footscray is already a great place to live – but we also know it can be even better. There are problems in our community: Footscray’s urban centre has been neglected. There is a dire lack of tree coverage and a lack of biodiversity. And we need better access to council services. As a non-binary person, I was on a 2-year waitlist for gender affirming healthcare, and I know there are huge gaps in the availability of council services across the West. If elected, I will commit to the revitalisation of Footscray, plant more native trees and promote native biodiversity. I’ll make Maribyrnong a truly safe place for the Queer community and advocate for more gender affirming healthcare across the west. I will push for more affordable housing and an urban agriculture plan to establish more community gardens. I left home at 15, lived in social housing, and am now a local renter.

I’m a Kingsville local running in this year’s council election with the Victorian Socialists because I believe our community’s well-being should come before profit.

Worse, there have been repeated industrial fires in nearby suburbs. Maribyrnong council, especially Yarraville, has the worst hospital admission rates for breathing problems. Young people are being admitted at almost triple the Australian average. We have to do something about this! If elected, I’ll prioritise preserving green spaces, like McIvor Reserve, and tackle air pollution by supporting community campaigns and advocating for low-emission zones, as per the Grattan Truck plan.

Like many of us, paying the rent is becoming painful! The dream of being able to afford a home in Croydon North is now increasingly out of reach, with property rates at their highest ever! The median house price is now over a $1,000,000 and units over $700,000. Are you a renter like me who would love to buy a property here? Perhaps you're a double income family with mortgage stress? A single parent doing their best to create a financially stable future, or a retiree not wanting to be forced out? If so, why is Maroondah Council jacking up the rates all the while forecasting a surplus increase of $18.52 million for the 2024/25 period. This level of greed is unacceptable! Tenants and mortgage holders are being hurt the most!

By freezing rates, we can help residents and businesses manage the cost of living.

Six-storey apartments in quiet residential streets are impractical, and our infrastructure will not handle the strain. I will work for a better deal.

As fellow Melton resident and Community Development worker, I have also in recent years, seen rapid growth within our City. But vital community infrastructure has failed to materialise. Two such examples include the unbuilt Melton Hospital and Melton rail line Electrification. Although state responsibilities, Melton Council can and must do more to ensure these projects are completed urgently. Council must advocate in a more forceful manner. On Council I will fight to ensure we are not forgotten by a system which failed to address local issues. And, with current high inflation, interest rate and general costs of living rising Council must play its role. I therefore propose an immediate Freeze on Council rates for the next 4 years. I will also support the proper maintenance and future redevelopment of our Melton Waves Swim Centre. Better planning of road works that do not hinder and clog local traffic.

The rising cost of living is hurting people, housing is hard to find and our local environment is under threat. As your Greens councillor, I will put people first by bolstering funding for local services, like maternity health, childcare, public parks, playgrounds, sporting facilities, and libraries. The Greens want to see more affordable housing built across Merri-bek so everyone has a place to call home. We have a wonderful community here in Fawkner but we need more support: safer and greener street for everyone – whether you are walking, riding or driving. And we need to tackle racism and Islamophobia. Like many people in our community I’ve been devastated by the war in Gaza.

I've been appalled by the lack of action on the cost of living crisis. I want the council to use its power to rein in rents, push back on profiteering supermarkets, build more public housing and expand public transport, including duplicating the Upfield line. It also needs to offer more subsidised services so people aren’t forced to use expensive private providers. I first became political in high school, horrified by Australia’s involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan and its criminal treatment of refugees. I'm now in my 30s, and Australia is still backing US wars and torturing refugees. These policies directly affect our community in Merri-bek and must end. For years I've been part of progressive movements. I joined Victorian Socialists because we are not just a party that stands for the right things on paper.

Merri-bek needs a mayor for four years, to be a truly effective advocate to the state government and carry out residents and ratepayers' agenda for a full Council term.

From the moment I was elected in 1996, I pledged to offer a fresh, proactive leadership style that prioritized the voices of our community. Throughout my service, I've remained committed to transparency, integrity, and accountability. Unfortunately, in the past four years, millions of ratepayer dollars have been wasted on issues like renaming the city, which would come at a significant financial cost without real benefits. Instead, that money should be invested in facilities that directly support our community, including Indigenous initiatives. I've also stood firmly against the removal of parking on Sydney Road, which would devastate local businesses, and questioned the costly use of external consultants, believing we should empower our own skilled employees. As a lifelong resident of 53 years, I've saved community assets, such as the Newlands Senior Citizen and Coburg Olympic Pool.

I’ve helped residents campaign against evictions, and fought against the demolition of public housing. While living standards for the majority decline, the rich get richer. They tell us to blame migrants and refugees. Councils have a responsibility to tackle urgent issues like the housing shortage and cost of living crisis. But we also need representatives who can stand up to the racist scapegoating of politicians and the media.

I stand for community values and healthy development. Having lived here for over 20 years, I can see how wonderful our LGA can be, and the opportunities for improvement. I was a founding member of the Sunraysia Mallee Suicide Prevention Network and am currently on the Consumer Advisory Committee for the Mildura Public Base Hospital. I play Eightball with the Sunraysia Eightball Association and love enjoying local arts and community events. I am excited to get behind the programs that are working and change the ones that aren't. I can't wait to be a part of a team that will build on what we already have to make MRCC a more vibrant, supportive and inclusive community. Let's work with the local police to prevent the incidents of crime, as well as working on programs to prevent crime in the first place. As a dedicated secondary school teacher, I am hopeful that our future citizens will contribute to our wider community in a positive way and am willing and able to show them how.

The cost of living pressures must be acknowledged and factored into all council decisions, the community's ability to pay higher Rates is at its limits, we must now reduce council expenditure. The cost of waste management is out of control, this council needs to priorities the collection of waste before trying to prevent it, if you need a bigger red bin you should get it. The safety of our streets and CBD must be a priority, we need to see more of the police rather than watch them drive by. Sunraysia must be a destination for tourism, businesses and families, this can only occur if we have financial stability, incentives to invest, housing supply, lower home owner costs and reduced local government bureaucracy.

I have been actively involved in many sporting bodies over the years as a volunteer and as a Councillor I helped to establish the Wallan Secondary College and the Wallan Multipurpose Community Centre. As a volunteer I helped out during the Black Saturday and Mickleham-Kilmore bushfire recovery efforts. Today Wallan and Beveridge are part of the Urban Growth Corridoor experiencing rapid growth and are suffering from a lack of vital infrastructure which will only worsen without urgent ongoing attention. Public health and wellbeing will suffer if this is not addressed by all levels of Government. With another 68 Thousand Homes forecast for this Region in the future , we will need to increase our sporting facilities, social infrastructure and road networks. The liveability of our Community will depend upon the attention that State, Federal and Local Government pays to our needs and as an experienced Local Representative I will persue these matters along with employment opportunities and investment in our locality.",bobcornish50@gmail.com,0400 394 743,

I’m running for council because I believe we need to get back to basics—fixing potholes, improving rubbish collection, and making sure our rates are spent where they matter most. I’m frustrated with the current council’s choices, I will make sure council uses rates money from the growth areas of council for growth area infrastructure and services – not sending our rates to the northern part of the shire – like spending $5 million to replace a wooden bridge in Seymour most will never use, while our roads are full of potholes and unsafe. I understand the importance of strong local infrastructure and services. I’ll push for better planning, so our growth is supported by schools, parks, and transport that benefit everyone.

The unprecedented growth in the Shire (Wallan, Beveridge and Hidden Valley) brings great challenges and also is tremendously exciting. I wish to continue the journey with our residents and ratepayers to ensure we maximize the benefits available to us all. There is unfinished business to which I would like to contribute and drive. I officiated at the sod turn of the Beveridge community center, the opening of that facility and now we are witnessing its expansion. We have plans to develop the sporting, leisure and recreational facilities of both Wallan and Beveridge to ease the growing pains. The South of the Shire needs both vision and experience if we are to maximize our potential and avoid the pitfalls we have witnessed in other growth areas. We all know we are not being funded adequately to build the infrastructure (roads etc.) required and we must maintain the strong links to State and Federal funding streams if we are to realize our potential.",davidandrewlowe@bigpond.com,0413 603 757,

Mitchell Shire is at a critical point. Our roads are riddled with potholes, illegal dumping is a constant eyesore, and we lack the community and sports facilities necessary for our expanding population.   Our council relies too heavily on residential rates, leaving us without the commercial base needed to fund essential infrastructure. Places like Beveridge and Wallan East still have no local shops, if you forget one ingredient to make dinner it means at least a 30 minute trip to the shops. This must change.   I’m committed to delivering practical solutions: better-maintained roads, increased green spaces, and much-needed recreational facilities like aquatic centers, sports ovals, and multi-use courts. It’s time we built a community where people can live, work, and play without traveling long distances for the basics.   The council owns Greenhill, and I’m excited to champion its development into a vibrant hub with walking tracks and open spaces.

I am passionate about preserving our unique creeks and bushland spaces. I’ve championed Council’s drive to net zero carbon and as Chair of the Environmental Advisory Committee, I’ve pushed Council to be more sustainable.

The state of our roads is unacceptable. Despite significant spending on repairs, inefficiencies remain, compromising safety for cyclists, cars, emergency and agricultural vehicles.

Ratepayers deserve clear, actionable advice before formal processes begin. It's time to address the ""poor cousin syndrome"" on the Westernport side, ensuring that sports facilities and infrastructure receive equal attention. Core services like roads, vegetation management, and waste collection must be prioritized. Illegal dumping can be reduced by offering affordable hard rubbish disposal options.

Borough of Queenscliffe Council,Queenscliffe Borough Council,"GRIGAU, Donnie",Donnie Grigau," This past term on the council has been eye-opening, revealing inefficiencies and poor decision-making that prioritises global over local issues, offering little value to Queenscliffe ratepayers. The Borough must focus on core responsibilities: asset renewal, maintenance, and efficient local services. With over $5.6 million allocated to staff wages and contractor fees from a small rate base of $7.5 million, little remains for asset upkeep. Queenscliffe is reliant on income from caravan park revenue, investments & operational grants. Without this income, council will be posting losses. I believe local government should be responsible and accountable for ratepayer funds, delivering local services and enhancing community amenities. We must prioritise asset maintenance to a community-acceptable standard, protect the environment, and ensure our community is liveable and attractive to visitors. The council must enforce local laws and policies fairly to represent everyone, avoiding division and favouritism.

We must ensure that Council staff are capable, with skills to counteract money wasted on consultants. With ratepayers in deep debt to ensure a home for their families, it is more important than ever for council to spend wisely. I would like to see more affordable land opened for housing, especially for young families, as it was in the past. Drainage and flood protection needs planning and commitment to prevent ongoing disasters. Being able to travel safely on our roads and footpaths is important, and more attention is needed to fund this. With a background in farming and retail, I am aware of the value small business has. My children all live in Greater Shepparton and own businesses, giving me insight into the issues faced. Australia Day is the 26th January and Council needs to respect this by re-establishing our celebration on this day.

I introduced live streaming of Council meetings, would extend this to briefings, and review to mitigate the proposed drastic bushfire planning changes for Mirboo North.

Stonnington City Council,Como Ward,"MILLEAR, Spencer James",Spencer James Millear," I live and work in Toorak and have been raising my family in Stonnington for the past ten years. I am actively involved in the community and am a passionate volunteer. I am running for Council as Stonnington needs a greater emphasis on balancing the needs of environmental care and maintenance of community assets with responsible financial management. As a previous director of ASX Listed Graincorp and Grain Growers Limited , and a graduate of the AICD , I bring the financial and commercial skills that are needed. Balance sheet analysis over 6 years of total debt and current assets shows a net movement of negative $79 million. While debt may have been incurred to deliver long term projects , going forward Councillors need to set a very clear direction for the financials. As a Councillor, I would expect to see a comprehensive set of monthly financials and to have regular discussions focused on the responsible and sustainable spending of rate payers funds. Many in the community tell me they want clean amenities and streets, but they do not want rates increased or the introduction of paid street parking.

However, that can all change if the left and greens are voted in, look at how other councils have deteriorated into an anarchic state of political correctness and wokeism, which can happen here, unless you make a stand and vote for me, it’s that simple. Seeing how council has spent our money, it’s clear that we’re not getting fair value for it, by funding frivolous projects with zero net benefit. This has to stop. The current Council Plan wants to change our behaviour, implementing changes that border on dystopian, read it and you’ll see why. One aspect that has to change is traffic management, which is a job that must be returned to the adults and doesn’t include any more concessions for cyclists, ebikes until they learn to obey the law, no riding through red lights or one-way streets the wrong way. If you vote for the same people you’ll get the same result. It’s time for fresh blood and a new approach that supports the majority.

Stonnington City Council,Hedgeley Dene Ward,"FAST, Josh",Josh Fast," Stonnington deserves a competent council that listens, acts, and delivers real solutions. For too long, Council has been operating in a self-congratulating echo chamber, which is disconnected from the needs of its residents. Instead of working with the community, it has prioritised unnecessary policies and processes that create more problems than they solve. Overspending and cost blow outs on trophy projects, obstruction, saying “no”, changing the names of holidays and implementing half-baked regulations that are hard to follow and fail to address basic community concerns. I’m running for council because I believe we need a fresh approach - one that gets back to basics. As a Liberal Party member, I am focussed on council delivering liberal values which start with strong financial management and cutting burdensome red tape. I am committed to listening, transparency, collaboration, and simplifying processes to make life easier for residents.

Wellington Shire Council,Northern Ward,"ILIOPOULOS, Christos",Christos Iliopoulos," When choosing an ideal place to live, we seek clean air, clean water, fresh organic food, excellent health services, and quality schools. Can local government influence these elements? Absolutely. We are fortunate to enjoy clean air. Our local government can ensure it remains so, by making environmentally conscious decisions. To improve water quality, programs for the installation of purification systems in all kitchens, could be undertaken with Gippsland Water to ensure high-quality water for all residents. Despite living in a food-growing district, much of our food is imported and mass-produced. Local government can establish twice-weekly local markets, offering fresh fruit, vegetables, seafood, and locally produced goods like cheese. This initiative would provide affordable, high-quality food and support small-scale local food production businesses. To attract high-quality health professionals and their families, local government must promote a high quality of life, including access to excellent schools. Establishing the Wellington Education Nexus can help achieve this by setting educational performance targets, and developing strategies for schools, drawing on the expertise of local educators. Local government goes beyond important services like 'rates, roads, and rubbish'.

We love where we live and want to see its unique environment preserved and protected. I am running in this election as I believe the current council has lost touch with reality. It has made some terrible and shameful decisions within the past 18 months. An example of the terrible decisions has been the privatisation of the aged care services, which has had a negative impact on the aged and disabled within our community. It was done in an undemocratic and underhanded sneaky manner with no consultation with the community and those who rely on those services. Earlier this year a petition was presented to council signed by over 5,000 people opposed to the privatisation of the swimming pools and gyms to private operators. If they can privatise the pools and gyms, then what will prevent them from privatising child care services?

I’m running as a candidate with Victorian Socialists because I believe in a society that’s more sustainable, more equitable and just than the capitalist system of today. Politicians are in the pockets of the rich, out of touch with the people they’re supposed to represent. In a wealthy society like Australia, everyone should have the chance to live a decent life. Local councils should take up questions of inequality and social justice, fight for a more equitable society and take action on issues like the housing shortage and cost of living crisis. I first got involved in activism by campaigning for refugee rights. Since then, I’ve been involved in campaigns against racism, for action on climate change and in solidarity with the people of Palestine.

I’m running in this year’s council election as a candidate with Victorian Socialists because I believe in a society that’s more sustainable, more equitable, and just than the capitalist system of today. My vision is rooted in the belief that the challenges we face today require bold, collective action and a fundamental shift towards justice and solidarity. Today, the people at the top are seeing their wealth grow rapidly, while many at the bottom are being left behind. Councils have a responsibility to help turn this situation around, and tackle urgent issues like the housing shortage and cost of living crisis.

I have lived in Thomastown for three years and have seen how the cost-of-living crisis has affected our community. We are all struggling with higher mortgages, rents and groceries. Change is needed, and it must involve putting people before profit. As a new mum I see firsthand how important council services are to our community. I want more funding for programs for kids, parents, and the disadvantaged. I also want to see more green spaces in the area. I’ve been a socialist for over 15 years. As a student I helped run a successful campaign to stop massive fee increases under the Abbott government. I’ve since been involved with campaigns to defend and expand healthcare, as well as access to public and affordable housing. A passion of mine has always been supporting refugees. Council can play a role in helping refugees in practical ways and by taking a stand against racism and discrimination.

Wyndham City Council,Wimba Ward,"SANDHU, Navpreet Singh",Navpreet Singh Sandhu," Our Council needs Councillors with relevant qualification, as opposed to any qualification, because the Council business is complex. Additionally, there is a concept of separation of powers (SOP). SOP prevents Councillors from influencing Council bureaucracy, with some minimal exceptions. Further complexity is that the bureaucrats are not required to be formally legal trained. So, a lay Councillor may not perform as effectively if her matter is blocked by a non-legal trained bureaucrat by incorrect application of rules. And, SOP preventing her from influencing the said bureaucrat. However, a legal trained Councillor may get nullified the said application using Administrative Law principles using minimal available internal channels, for example. Therefore, writing flowery wording in an election material on standard citizen interest matters is one thing, having a capability to get it delivered is another. Navpreet, who lives locally from a decade with his wife and child, is an Australia trained lawyer passionate about the rights of ordinary Australians. Hence, him being a proudly independent candidate. See details of his social work done on fb.com/WimbaWard.

I’m a designer who has worked in communications here and abroad.

Burnley Park was a godsend during COVID and now it needs some love, especially Murphy’s Hut (aka Burnley Cottage). I am a voice for families, for dog-walkers, for sporting clubs. I am a voice for our senior citizens and for our childcares. I am a voice for the voiceless, the renters, the volunteers. I am a voice for our local traders and bustling streets.

I’m standing as an Independent for Boulevard Ward with support from the Yarra for All community movement. We’re all busy, so we need Yarra Council to work for us. That means: focusing on delivering the fundamentals of roads, rates, rubbish and graffiti removal; creating a real plan to revitalise Bridge Road and Victoria Street; delivering parks and open space in the right places; and responding to the State Government pressure for more housing with the right mix of dwellings for our community and sensible planning rules that protect liveability. But most of all, it means a return to democracy where residents are consulted, have a right to a say and their concerns are heard.

If elected I will fight to make sure Yarra City Council gets back to ensuring foundational services such as waste management, road maintenance, support for local communities and more are prioritised. The overdevelopment of our suburbs coupled with convoluted waste management strategies has resulted in our community swimming up to its neck in pollution and rubbish.

I’m running for council because I believe genuine democracy begins at the local level. Community activism is the starting place for any successful political campaign – whether it’s to protect public assets like parks, schools and housing, or defend renters and prevent evictions. In Yarra, democracy has gone backwards. It’s become much harder to engage with council processes, and at the same time council has increased the cost of services, cut spending on infrastructure, privatised aged care and knocked back funding for social housing. If elected, I’ll campaign to expand council-run services, protect public housing and ensure new residential developments include green spaces and social housing. I’ll also move for council to adopt a boycott, divestment and sanctions policy on Israel. I’ve been involved in activism since high school, including campaigns for climate action, refugees, LGBTQI+ rights and more. I joined Victorian Socialists because of its focus on grassroots activism over political careerism and its clear anti-capitalist principles. Now more than ever, we need representatives who will stand up to state government and developers, and ensure the community is heard.",annie.toller@victoriansocialists.org.au,,Socialist

My first task will be to cut waste and unnecessary spending; reducing management and executive roles that add little value.

I’ll be the experienced independent local voice demanding a better budget bottom-line, while delivering core council services for the residents and ratepayers of Richmond and Cremorne. We must prioritise the needs of our community and not politics, and my vision for change includes: > Reforming parking policies to better serve residents and local traders including first parking permits free for all ratepayers and renters. > Reducing the 30% Bin Tax, thereby lowering rates and cost of living for renters. > Removing excessive bins that occupy valuable real estate. > Revitalising our residential streets with road and footpath repairs, waste and graffiti removal, and safer street lighting. > Renovating Richmond Library with world-class facilities and free internet. > Reviving community spirit and the local economy with Swan Street and Bridge Road multi-cultural community festivals. Through an independent audit weeding out wasteful practices currently employed by council, we can harness the potential Lennox has to offer.

I’m currently a Councillor, leading the opposition community independents. Yarra Council needs to change what it does and the way it works. Currently, too many decisions are made according to airy schemes or hidden agendas, with no thought for residents for example lost parking, privatised services, and slashing democracy. We can do better. If elected with other Independents, I'll call an emergency Council meeting, change the way things are done, and make things happen. For example, no loss of street parking that you want kept. Street bin collection in some cases and improved graffiti removal. Council fixes of stormwater drains. Build housing for low-income workers on Council land. Make developers include social housing. Reintroduce Brunswick, Gertrude St Projection festivals; get the Spanish festival buzzing again. Protect Atherton Garden Housing towers, with Council-run campaign, build a futsal field there. Link local businesses with kids from Atherton to boost employment. We'll reverse anti-democratic changes - reduced meetings, lost question time - made by current majority and restructure Council finances to free resources for frontline services. Exciting change for Fitzroy and Yarra is possible in the next few weeks.",stephenjolly99@hotmail.com,0447 506 625,

I’m running as a candidate with Victorian Socialists because I believe in a society that’s more sustainable, more equitable and just than the capitalist system of today.

Councils have a responsibility to tackle urgent issues like the housing shortage and cost of living crisis. For many years, I’ve been involved in campaigns against racism, for action on climate change, and for marriage equality. These campaigns have taught me that we don’t win equality by asking nicely, but only by mobilising ordinary people in our tens of thousands and fighting for it. More recently, I’ve campaigned in solidarity with the people of Palestine. I believe councils should be a place where questions of social justice are raised and acted on.

I'm an award winning artist and academic, and my research in computer music was awarded a Eureka Prize for innovations in computer science.

I will work to support social wellbeing and culture, and as an artist running a small business, I want to see a thriving local economy.

The hills community has embraced us like family, and now it’s my turn to give back by serving as your councillor. At 21, I came to Australia with just $1,000 and the determination to pursue a Master’s in IT. Since then, I’ve built a life here, overcome challenges, started businesses, and helped others do the same. My journey as a migrant, entrepreneur, author, and consultant has taught me how to solve problems and create opportunities. Now, I’m ready to apply these skills to tackle the issues we face as a community. Running as an Independent, I am committed to serving you, the residents. This independence enables me to focus solely on what matters most to you. With integrity and dedication, I will deliver real, tangible results for Lyster Ward. If elected, I will address traffic and parking concerns around schools, improve council accountability and communication, support health and well-being initiatives, and make council resources more accessible.

Yarra Ranges Shire Council,Melba Ward,"TODOROV, Sophie",Sophie Todorov," I am the Mayor and Independent Councillor for Melba Ward, dedicated to the Yarra Ranges for almost 30 years through emergency services, community activities, and education. I have influenced liveable towns, healthy people, and safe and strong communities by listening to residents and businesses. On Council, I've worked on improving flood responses and securing drainage funding. I’ve also focussed on responsible development, heritage protection, and green spaces. Across Melba, I've supported local festivals, food relief, and community projects such as the Mooroolbark Community Garden and Community House. As the Councillor delegate for Health and Wellbeing, I've ensured community voice drives effective programs. I strongly advocate to other levels of government for needed infrastructure improvements such as drainage, roads and disaster-ready buildings, and social housing. I genuinely value volunteers, arts, active living, and historical and Indigenous connection. I’m committed to addressing resident and business needs, advocating for an Urban Aquatic and Leisure facility, and upgrades to McDermott Reserve and Red Earth Community Park. I prioritise transparent decisions, environmental protection, and broad community input. I will continue to be your trusted active representative for Melba Ward. Grow Well Together.

Yarra Ranges Shire Council,Melba Ward,"TEMPLER, Chris",Chris Templer," I love where I live. The Melba Ward of Lilydale and Mooroolbark is where I’ve lived and raised my family for over 20 years, being a part of community groups, sporting clubs and local events. As a parent, business owner and ratepayer I can see we need some changes at the Council. The Current council needs a change. I want to be the Councilor for the Melba Ward because being a part of the local schools, footy club, community action groups, RSL etc has always kept me in touch with what’s going well in our community but also where the council is falling behind on delivering what we need locally. There are a lot of grassroots issues being overlooked at the moment and I want to bring a new level of communication to being the local Councilor. I want to be sure that everyone that needs help with council issues is taken seriously and their problems are always dealt with. I’ll communicate and represent what you have to say because I want this area to keep improving and thriving for my family and yours. Things can always be better, give me your vote and I’ll do the work for you.",Chris4council2024@outlook.com,,

As a lifelong local, I share in the triumphs, as well as the challenges, that shape our diverse community. Our Council has a significant presence in our lives, from local roads to rubbish collection to our kids’ playgrounds. As rates and charges continue to increase, our Council doesn’t appear to be working for us. It's time to bring back common sense on the Council and get Council to go back to basics. We need a Council that prioritises the needs of the community. If I am elected, I will stand strong, for you and with you, in bringing the Council back to basics: Roads, Rates, Rubbish, Recreation and Repairs. I will use my position on Council to advocate for the improvement of local infrastructure, against overdevelopment and to hold the Council accountable for its actions. It’s time to put common sense back into Council. It's time to put our community back on track and look to the future. The time is right for change on the Council.

During those 12 years, investment in the O’Shannassy Ward has been the best we’ve ever seen, roads to community infrastructure build, footpaths, bridges, recreation reserves & pavilions, with much more still to be done, in particular Wesburn Park, Warburton, Yarra Junction and also finalising the Yarra Junction Place Plan then the Yarra Junction Township Design Framework, a project I instigated earlier this current Council term. I strongly support the Council 2024-25 Budget with a Capital Works Program delivering the construction of Stage 1 of the Warburton Mountain Bike Destination, plus those much needed 120 community services.

I know and understand our community, and adore our precious natural environment and rural character. I’ve been lucky to talk to many people about what matters most to them, and if elected I will ensure everyone’s voice is heard. As we all struggle with the cost-of-living, housing/rental and climate crises, we need our council to work harder for the community. If elected as your councillor, I’ll prioritise: 1) bringing down your power bills and taking climate action through solar bulk-buying, including for renters, and supporting households to get off gas; 2) pushing genuinely affordable and sustainable housing; 3) finding the balance between tourism and the ability for locals to enjoy the area they live in; 4) supporting arts, festivals and community hubs to build a thriving culture scene; 5) fight to protect our forests and waterways; and 6) integrity and accountability on council.

Yarra Ranges Shire Council,O'Shannassy Ward,"DUKE, Karen",Karen Duke," I’m Karen Duke a candidate running for Yarra Ranges Council in the O’Shannassy ward. I’m a resident in the Upper Yarra Valley and love where I live. This is the reason I am running for council as I feel our ward has been left behind compared to the other wards in the Shire for too long. I am frustrated with our community being told what we should have, instead of what is essential and the actual needs of the residents. This needs to change now. I could talk about economics and tourism, but I feel that communication, honesty, accountability, and transparency is key to our community voice for a balance. I believe in change as long as it is good for the community and the wellbeing of residents for a positive outcome. I am an independent with no political alliances. A vote for me will ensure our unique, beautiful and vibrant community is ready to move forward with 'your voice at council.'",karendukeoshannassy@outlook.com,,

I am a born & raised local who has worked with many community groups and local volunteers in the O'Shannessy Ward. Our small and diverse rural communities are at present concerned with cost of living pressures, and we need to ensure that the essential Council services are delivered first and foremost, especially now that we have rate capping. I wish to also support positive local community & economic development that protects our unique rural character & carefully considers our emergency management risks including fire & flooding. I bring working experience in the fields of small business, local economic & community development including regenerative tourism. I have worked with and within local, state and federal government organisations. I have a Masters in Urban Horticulture so I understand all the pressures on our agricultural industries & natural resources from increasing urban density and climate change.

Yarra Ranges Shire Council,O'Shannassy Ward,"LITTLE, Dylan J.",Dylan J. Little," Hi, I’m Dylan. I’m running in this year’s council election as a candidate with Victorian Socialists because I believe in a society that’s more sustainable, equitable and just than the capitalist system we live under today. I’m a Wesburn local and have lived in the area for 20 years. I’m an arborist and a member of the Australian Workers’ Union. Politicians at all levels of government are in the pockets of the rich, increasingly losing touch with the people they’re supposed to represent. Wealth inequality is soaring, with many working-class people struggling to get by while the rich prosper. Councils have a responsibility to tackle issues like the housing shortage and cost of living crisis, to improve living standards for all. I’ve been an activist for many years, campaigning against racism, for public housing, refugees, and recently in solidarity with the people of Palestine. I believe councils should be a place where questions of social justice are raised and acted on. If elected in October, I promise to champion our community’s needs and work towards creating the better world we all deserve.",dylan.little@victoriansocialists.org.au,,Socialist

I believe council needs to focus on the core fundamentals of services to the community, make timely and common-sense decisions, and demonstrate sound financial management within budget.

Yarra Ranges Shire Council,Walling Ward,"COX, Len",Len Cox," I am council's most experienced councillor and have the enthusiasm and commitment to continue. This term I convinced council to buy the high school land at 150 Cambridge Rd. The State Government were to sell it for unit development. If Re-elected I will ensure it is turned into parkland, bike tracks, picnic areas & bushland. I was angry when council closed Kilsyth Pool. If re-elected with a new council, I will work with them to rebuild it better than ever. Montrose quarry is wanting to expand , but I have stopped it before & will again. In the past I have been responsible for developing Lilydale lake, Japara House, Montrose Town Centre, rejuvinating Pinks reserve, including roofing netball courts, new basketball court and the new football pavilion. Very important is rates. Walling Ward is next to Maroondah council whose rates are much less than ours. If I am re-elected & the majority approve, I will negotiate with state government and Maroondah council to include Walling Ward in Maroondah. You would keep all services & save $650.00 per year.
